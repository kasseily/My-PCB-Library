# Altium PCB  Libraries

I created this repository to streamline and centralize (as well as versioning, of course) my PCB component footprints.

I am painstainkingly going through each and every single component, making sure all the layers are drawn properly, as well as having 3D models for each.
All this work will save much time later on when designing a PCB.
I started populating it with VRegs, Capacitors, and Resistors, but will slowly increase this to other components as well.
To do later will be creating a Schematic Library as well.
